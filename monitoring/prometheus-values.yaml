    ## AdditionalScrapeConfigs allows specifying additional Prometheus scrape configurations. Scrape configurations
    ## are appended to the configurations generated by the Prometheus Operator. Job configurations must have the form
    ## as specified in the official Prometheus documentation:
    ## https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config. As scrape configs are
    ## appended, the user is responsible to make sure it is valid. Note that using this feature may expose the possibility
    ## to break upgrades of Prometheus. It is advised to review Prometheus release notes to ensure that no incompatible
    ## scrape configs are going to break Prometheus after the upgrade.
    ## AdditionalScrapeConfigs can be defined as a list or as a templated string.
    ##
    ## The scrape configuration example below will find master nodes, provided they have the name .*mst.*, relabel the
    ## port to 2379 and allow etcd scraping provided it is running on all Kubernetes master nodes
